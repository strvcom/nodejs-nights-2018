## Introduction
This repository serves as an online course for learning Node.js.
It’s here to help those who want to learn more about Node.js and backend to develop a backend API.

#### Goal
To give you a fundamental understanding of backend and Node.js.

Presenters in our courses demonstrated the best practices in building Node.js applications based on their experience gained from numerous projects.

#### Source
This repository ("online course") was created and transformed from **STRV Nodejs Nights**–
a free offline course focused on Node.js created by [STRV](https://www.strv.com/).

#### Prerequisites
The course requires at least a junior-level knowledge of programming (don’t need to be experienced with javascript, Node.js or backend itself).

## Contents

This repository & course contains 9 lectures, with the first 3 lectures being general while the rest 6 sections
focus on building up one simple project from scratch to demonstrate all the practices.

Each lecture contains a video recording of the presentation with live coding and sample codes.

The course focuses on understanding good architectural practices and project setups. Please keep it mind that for the purpose of the course, it’s simplified compared to big production app to easily demonstrate fundamental patterns.

## Materials

#### Branches
- **Master** branch contains the final solution.
- **Lecture branches (e.b. 01-javascript)** contain parts of the solution finished after that lecture.
